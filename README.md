# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews projects**, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage Three**, you will take the connected application you yu built in Stage One and Stage Two and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, youâ€™ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using Lighthouse.

### How to use the project

1. Go to the dist folder

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. You can start a webserver with Python. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your HTTP server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

P.s. You need first to start the server for the restaurants!
